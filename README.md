# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview
Kickstarter is a well-known site for crowdfunding various program and produt campaigns. Lousie has decided to use Kickstarter to help fund her play. To help guide her to success, she has turned to me for help to attain her goal.
Using data from 4,000 Kickstarter campaigns, I will assess trends and outcomes to guide Louise to having the best chances of reaching the goal for her campaign. 
With the help of advanced Excel formulas I will make predictions about the best time, length, and goal for Louise's campaign to increases her chances of success. 
## Purpose
Playwright, Louise, is looking to start a crowdfunding campaign for her play, Fever. She has an ambitious goal of $10,000. She is unsure of the best way to go about proceding with her campaign.
By looking at similar play campaigns I will provide data about the relationships between best month to launch her campaign, the length it should be live for, and the probability of reaching her intended goal. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date
Through filtering the Kickstarter data by category, "theater", launch month, and outcomes, "canceled", "failed", and "successful", into a pivot table and graph we are presented with a visual representation of campaign outcomes.
Based on the data in the table, Mid-Spring is the most popular time to launch a campaign, it is also the time with the most success.
May is the month with the most successful launches with 66% of the campaigns successfully reaching their goals.
As a result of being a month with a high number of launched campaigns, this leads to an expected increase in failed campaigns, as May also saw 52 (or 31%) of campaigns fail. 
Campaigns launched in the fall into early Spring are the least likely to be successful.
October saw 43% of launched campaigns not reaching their goals. 
### Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals
Through filtering the Kickstarter data by category, "theater", campaign goals in monetary ranges, and outcomes, "canceled", "failed", and "successful", into a pivot table and graph we are presented with a visual representation of campaign outcomes in relationship to their fundraising goal.
Campaigns are most likely to be successful if their goal falls below $5,000. The graph also presents the high likelyhood of failure for campaigns with goals $45,000 and above.
